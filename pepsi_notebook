objective: develop model for prediction of crop assessment based on environmental parameters
           
//the parameters available which could affect this score are

    • growth site : A, B, C, D, E 
        • Latitude : float
        • Elevation :  float
        • Sowing Date : diff with harvest float var
        • Harvest Date : same
        • Soil Parameter A : Int
        • Soil Parameter B : float
        • Fertilizer Amount : float

    • Growth year : 2015, 2016, 2017

    • Weather 
        • Variable A : float
        • Variable B : float
        • Variable D : float
        • Variable E : float
        • Variable F : float

    • Growth Stage (maybe days growing?)

    • Variety : M/B

    • Assessment Type : (A/C) - (A-Z)
                        : Y

//strategy

    // first I must divide data by the assessment technique
       there is likely variation between the assessment technique which can be explored
            test for this by graphing assessment score by the assessment method

    // or should I just use the assessment as a categorical variable...? hmmm

    //I think I'm gonna turn the assessment type into dummies
